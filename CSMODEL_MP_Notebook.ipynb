    "## Dataset Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is derived from the Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) conducted in 2015 by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) nationwide. The survey, undertaken every three (3) years, aims to provide data on family income, income inequality among Filipino families, and family consumption and expenditures for the country and its seventeen (17) administrative regions. It is conducted in two separate operations using two separate questionnaires with the same set of questions. These data are the basic inputs in the estimation of the country’s poverty threshold and incidence and the basis for policies and programs of the government to improve the socio-economic conditions of the Filipino people.\n",

Hence, we create a new variable, **`Income Class`**, which identifies which income class the following household belongs to. As reference, we used the indicative range at 2015 prices established by the Philippine Institute of Developmental Studies (PIDS) since the survey was conducted at the year 2015. The income classes are as follows:\n",
    "- Poor: less than Php 9,100\n",
    "- Low-income class: Php 9,100 - Php 18,200\n",
    "- Lower middle-income class: Php 18,200 - Php 36,400\n",

    "With the values presented in the graph, we can easily see that **NCR** has the highest average total household income, followed by **III - Central Luzon** and **VIA - CALABARZON**, respectively. According to the PIDS, urban households are predominantly middle income. On the other hand, among rural households, only a third are middle income, while three-fifths are low income. The middle class dominantly reside in these three aforementioned regions as these areas have wide access to manufacturing and commercial establishments. The \n",
    "predominance of the middle-income class in these three regions may be reason for their high average total household incomes compared to the other regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to note that the data is highly dispersed as seen in their corresponding standard deviations. Their standard deviations are nearly equiavalent to their respective means, if not, even much higher than their mean. Thus, the **`Total Household Income`** among different households has great variability."

    "After grouping the households into different income classes and computing for the mean of their total number of dependents, it can be seen that the mean of the total number of dependents per income class are close to each other. Although one eye-catching result was the rich class having the lowest mean of dependents, and the low-income class having the highest mean of dependents. Despite earning the highest income, households coming from the rich class are actually feeding less mouths than those coming from lower classes. Additionally, another noticeable difference is that the higher the income class, the lower the mean of their total number of dependents."

    "* **Test Statistic**: 15.06\n",
    "\n",
    "* **P-Value**: 0.00\n",
    "\n",
    "With the p-value of **0.00** being less than the significance level of **0.05**, the conclusion our group had reached was to **reject the null hypothesis**, suggesting that there is a statistical difference between the average total income between households whose main income is via wage/salaries and households whose main income is via entrepreneurial activities. \n",
    "\n",
    "This information provides a better understanding for households examining options for sources of income they may work towards. In consideration of the range of responses that could be found within the **Other sources of Income** category, the group had chosen to compare only wage/salaries and entrepreneurial activities as they were the more conventional sources of income. Understanding the difference is vital to understanding the risks in choosing sources of income for a household. However, we still need to consider that there are many factors in choosing a source of income. There may be outliers such as people with different circumstances like those earning very low or very high incomes."

    "#### Insights and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the data from the table, the chi² test function above was able to compute the following values (rounded off to 2nd decimal place):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test Statistic**: 4294.01\n",
    "- **P-Value**: 0.00\n",
    "- **Degree of Freedom**: 16\n",
    "\n",
    "With the p-value of **0.00** being *less than* the significance level of **0.05**, the conclusion our group had reached was to **reject the *null hypothesis***, suggesting that there is a statistical difference between the access to electricity between households in different regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding that there are differences between each region's ability to provide households with electricity is key to understanding how to address the lack thereof. While there may be households here that do not require electricity, those are more likely outliers to the general sample as the data from the EDA 2 shows that a majority of households in the sample use it. In that sense, the fact that there is a significant difference between the availability of electricity of households should definitely be taken note of by regional governance in order to rectify issues with their respective power grids."
